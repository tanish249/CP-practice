## Problem

### The Cheaper Cab

Chef has to travel to another place. For this, he can avail any one of two cab services.

- The first cab service charges $X$ rupees.
- The second cab service charges $Y$ rupees.

Chef wants to spend the  **minimum**  amount of money. Which cab service should Chef take?

### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ - the prices of first and second cab services respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `FIRST` if the first cab service is cheaper, output `SECOND` if the second cab service is cheaper, output `ANY` if both cab services have the same price.

You may print each character of `FIRST`, `SECOND` and `ANY` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `any`, `aNy`, `Any` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
