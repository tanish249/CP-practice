## Problem

### Multivitamin Tablets

The doctor prescribed Chef to take a multivitamin tablet $3$ times a day for the next $X$ days.

Chef already has $Y$ multivitamin tablets.

Determine if Chef has enough tablets for these $X$ days or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the number of days Chef needs to take tablets and the number of tablets Chef already has.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if Chef has enough tablets for these $X$ days. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2000$
- $1 \le X \le 100$
- $0 \le Y \le 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 10
12 0
10 29
10 30

```

```
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Chef has $10$ tablets and Chef needs $3$ tablets for $1$ day. Therefore Chef has enough tablets.

 **Test Case 2:**  Chef has $0$ tablets and Chef needs $36$ tablets for $12$ days. Therefore Chef does not have enough tablets.

 **Test Case 3:**  Chef has $29$ tablets and Chef needs $30$ tablets for $10$ days. Therefore Chef does not have enough tablets.

 **Test Case 4:**  Chef has $30$ tablets and Chef needs $30$ tablets for $10$ days. Therefore Chef has enough tablets.
