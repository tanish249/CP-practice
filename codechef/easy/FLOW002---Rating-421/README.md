## Problem

### Find Remainder

Write a program to find the remainder when an integer  **A**  is divided by an integer  **B**.

### Input

The first line contains an integer  **T**, the total number of test cases. Then  **T**  lines follow, each line contains two Integers  **A**  and  **B**.

### Output

For each test case, find the remainder when  **A**  is divided by  **B**, and display it in a new line.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000
