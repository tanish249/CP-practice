## Problem

### Chefland Games

In Chefland, a tennis game involves $4$ referees.
Each referee has to point out whether he considers the ball to be inside limits or outside limits. The ball is considered to be `IN` if and only if  **all**  the referees agree that it was inside limits.

Given the decision of the $4$ referees, help Chef determine whether the ball is considered inside limits or not.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing $4$ integers $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$ denoting the decision of the respective referees.

Here $R$ can be either $0$ or $1$ where $0$ would denote that the referee considered the ball to be inside limits whereas $1$ denotes that they consider it to be outside limits.

### Output Format

For each test case, output `IN` if the ball is considered to be inside limits by all referees and `OUT` otherwise.

The checker is case-insensitive so answers like `in`, `In`, and `IN` would be considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 20$
- $0 \leq R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4 \leq 1$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1

```

```
OUT
IN
OUT
OUT

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Referees $1$ and $2$ do not consider the ball to be `IN`. Thus, the ball is `OUT`.

 **Test case $2$:**  All referees consider the ball to be `IN`. Thus, the ball is `IN`.

 **Test case $3$:**  Referee $4$ does not consider the ball to be `IN`. Thus, the ball is `OUT`.

 **Test case $4$:**  No referee considers the ball to be `IN`. Thus, the ball is `OUT`.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
    h=a+b+c+d
    if h>=1:
        print("OUT")
    else:
        print("IN")
```
