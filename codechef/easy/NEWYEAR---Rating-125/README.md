## Problem

### Happy New Year!

Currently, it is $X:00$ hours on December $31^{st}$ and you are wondering how many hours are left till midnight.

For the purposes of this problem, we use a $24$ hour system. So, $X$ can range from $0$ to $23$, and you need to tell the number of hours left till $00:00$ of the next day.

### Input Format
- The first and only line of input contains a single integer $X$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the number of hours left till midnight

### Constraints
- $0 \le X \le 23$

### Explanation:

### Sample 2:
