## Problem

### Tom and Jerry Chase

In a classic chase, Tom is running after Jerry as Jerry has eaten Tom's favourite food.

Jerry is running at a speed of $X$ metres per second while Tom is chasing him at a speed of $Y$ metres per second. Determine whether Tom will be able to catch Jerry.

Note that initially Jerry is not at the same position as Tom.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the speeds of Jerry and Tom respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Tom will be able to catch Jerry. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You can print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example `NO`, `no`, `No`, and `nO` are all considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \le X, Y \le 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2 3
4 1
1 1
3 5

```

```
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Jerry is running at the speed of $2$ metres per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of $3$ metres per second. Since Jerry's speed is less than Tom's, Tom will eventually catch Jerry.

 **Test case $2$:**  Jerry is running at the speed of $4$ metres per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of $1$ metres per second. Since Jerry's speed is higher than Tom's, Tom will never be able to catch Jerry.

 **Test case $3$:**  Jerry is running at the speed of $1$ metre per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of $1$ metre per second. Since Jerry's speed is same as that of Tom's and both of them are not at the same position, Tom will never be able to catch Jerry.

 **Test case $4$:**  Jerry is running at the speed of $3$ metres per second while Tom is chasing him at the speed of $5$ metres per second. Since Jerry's speed is less than Tom's, Tom will eventually catch Jerry.

for _ in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    if b>a:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
