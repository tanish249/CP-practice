## Problem

### Judged

The tech fest of IIT Ropar,  *Advitiya*, has a talent show as part of the festivities.
The preliminary round of the talent show has participants being evaluated by $5$ judges, and only those participants whose performance was liked by  **at least $4$**  judges will qualify for the next round.

Anuj participated in the talent show, and now wants to know if he'll qualify or not.
You are given the responses of all $5$ judges — help Anuj decide whether he qualified!
Each judge's response is given to you as a binary integer, where:

- $0$ means the judge didn't like Anuj's performance.
- $1$ means the judge liked Anuj's performance.
### Input Format
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing $5$ space-separated integers $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5$ — the responses of the judges.
### Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing the string `"YES"` (without quotes) if Anuj qualifies for the next round, and `"NO"` (without quotes) if he doesn't qualify.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings `NO`, `no`, `No`, and `nO` will all be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $0 \le R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5 \le 1$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1

```

```
NO
NO
YES
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Only $2$ judges liked Anuj's performance, so he does not qualify.

 **Test case $2$:**  Only $3$ judges liked Anuj's performance, so he does not qualify.

 **Test case $3$:**  $4$ judges liked Anuj's performance, so he does qualify this time.

- In the second case, only $3$ judges liked his performance so he does not qualify.
- In the third case, $4$ judges liked his performance so he qualified.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c,d,e=map(int,input().split())
    h=a+b+c+d+e
    if h>=4:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
