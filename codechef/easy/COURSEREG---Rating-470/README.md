## Problem

### Course Registration

There is a group of $N$ friends who wish to enroll in a course together. The course has a maximum capacity of $M$ students that can register for it. If there are $K$ other students who have already enrolled in the course, determine if it will still be possible for all the $N$ friends to do so or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers $N$, $M$ and $K$ - the size of the friend group, the capacity of the course and the number of students already registered for the course.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `Yes` if it will be possible for all the $N$ friends to register for the course. Otherwise output `No`.

You may print each character of `Yes` and `No` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `YES` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq M \leq 100$
- $0 \leq K \leq M$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
2 50 27
5 40 38
100 100 0

```

```
Yes
No
Yes

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  The $2$ friends can enroll in the course as it has enough seats to accommodate them and the $27$ other students at the same time.

 **Test Case 2:**  The course does not have enough seats to accommodate the $5$ friends and the $38$ other students at the same time.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    h=a+c 
    if b>=h:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
