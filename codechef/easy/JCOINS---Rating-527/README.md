## Problem

### Janmansh and Coins

Janmansh received $X$ coins of $10$ rupees and $Y$ coins of $5$ rupees from Chingari. Since he is weak in math, can you find out how much total money does he have?

### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$, $Y$ - the number of $10$ and $5$ rupee coins respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output how much total money does Janmansh have.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $0 \le X, Y \le 100$
### Sample 1:

3 4

```

```
25
50

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case-1:**  He has $2$ coins of $10$ rupees and $1$ coin of $5$ rupees. Hence he has $2 \cdot 10+5 = 25$ rupees.

 **Test case-2:**  He has $3$ coins of $10$ rupees and $4$ coins of $5$ rupees. Hence he has $3 \cdot 10 + 4 \cdot 5 = 50$ rupees.
