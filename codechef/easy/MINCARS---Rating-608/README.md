A single car can accommodate at most $4$ people.

$N$ friends want to go to a restaurant for a party. Find the  **minimum**  number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $N$ - denoting the number of friends.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $2 \leq N \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  There are only $4$ friends and a single car can accommodate $4$ people. Thus, only $1$ car is required.

 **Test Case $2$:**  There are only $2$ friends and a single car can accommodate $4$ people. Thus, only $1$ car is required

 **Test Case $3$:**  There are $7$ friends and $2$ cars can accommodate $8$ people. Thus, $2$ cars are required.
